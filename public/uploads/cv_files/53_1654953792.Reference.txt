-> Success Life Skills
	* If you want to be rich or achieve anything meaningful in life, you must be ready to put in the work.
	* It is wise to focus on your strengths for the short term and invest heavily into acquiring the remaining
	skills over the next couple of years.
	
	1. Discipline
	2. Emotional Intelligence
	3. Self-motivation
	4. Maintaining Focus
	5. Reading
	6. Play the Long Game
	7. Continuous Learning

	1. Discipline
	- No matter the whether or how you feel, discipline is what takes you to the finish line.
	- It means taking care of the most important tasks relating to your long-term goal before anything else.
	- Do not let a single day pass without closing the distance between your current reality and your target.
	- Most fail because they cannot put in the work over an extended period of time
	- To develop discipline:
		- Define what you want
		- Evaluate why you want it
		- Eliminate distractions
		- Prioritise the most important tasks over everything else.
		- Track Progress.
		- Keep yourself accountable.
	- Habits and discipline requires that you start with the small things first, then work your way up with consistency
	- Organize your life.

	2. Emotional Intelligence
	- Note that high IQ rarely correlates to financial success.
	- Money has to do with understanding how people work, how they think, what they want, need, and how to really understand that information
	- EQ is far more critical in business and life than IQ. You don't have to be smart in school to be rich
	- Spend time learning about others, interacting with them and developing your social skills.
	- To asses your EQ, ask yourself: how well do I understand people?, is it easy for you to understand how people feel, what they want in general,
	and what them behave the way they do.
	- Next time you have conversation with someone try to actively listen and understand the person. When they talk be present, don't listen to the 
	voice in your head and only think of what to ask.
	- to be successful you need to work with others and be in control of your feelings.

	3. Self-motivation
	- Things will get hard in your journey. And honestly, you are in this alone. Your family and friends will be around, but it up to you to put in the time and effort.
	- Without being able to motivate yourself, you will not make it.
	- It's your ability to overcome obstacles both in your mind (thoughts that tell you you cannot make it) and your environment (e.g. people around you, pulling you back).
	- being lazy can add up and snowball into a life of mediocrity.
	- Change the background of your device to fit the life you want. We look at them multiple times in a day, Every time you see them, they should remind you the life you want
	and make you work harder if you want to get it.

	4. Maintaining Focus.
	- Everything around you has been engineered to distract you.
	- Currently attention is the new currency.
	- It is increasingly harder to maintain focus because more and more distractions try to hook you in everyday.
	- To be successful prioritize activities that move you towards your overarching goal.
	- Ask yourself, how focused are you on your journey?
	- Break down what you did all day from when you woke up. How many of the things you did contributed to your journey? How many are time wasters?
	- Analyze your day atleast once a week to determine if your focus is increasing or decreasing over time. (you may find that you wasting  incredible amounts of time
	on things that add little to no value to your current or future life.)

	5. Reading
	- Successful people read a lot of books!
	- On average they read 50 books a year, the average person reads only 1.5. You need to start reading now.
	- Reading is better than watching videos or audiobooks in most situations because the brain processes text differently than it does with video and audio. 
	- Books help you absorb the knowledge someone gathered in a lifetime, in a single week from reading a book.
	- Reading evolves you main asset which is yourself.

	6. Play the Long Game
	- Everything you have done in your life so far has been for the immediate future.
	- To be successful your mindset has to change dramatically. You need to stop looking for shortcuts for get rich-quick methods
	- It will take between seven and ten years to change your life.
	- Think ahead, take action now to impact your long term
	- Do it now, so that 10 years from now you don't find yourself repeating the same mistakes.
	- Focus on only the things that will take you close to your goals a possible.
	- Eliminate anything that will stand in your way. 

	7. Continuous Learning
	- Successful people never stop learning.
	- The learn through reading books, and everything else around them.
	- You can learn a lot from life by observing what's happening
	- success depends on your ability to do continuous learning
	- acquire new skills and use those to further yourself.
	- ***The goal is not to know as many things as possible but undersatnd as many things as you can.***
	- there is a difference between knowing and understanding.
		- knowing 
			- fills you with information
			- drives you mad
		- understanding 
			- allows you to connect the dots others might not be able to see.
			- helps you understand the world.
	- Always try to learn something of real value, that makes your life and of those around you better.
	- Continuous learning is about improving your current self consistently.
	- Will make you a better decision maker, and thus a fulfilling life.
	- The moment you stop learning, you start dying.



Personal Growth:

1. How the top 5% people think
	- If you don't do anything to change your life,
	you will simply stay where you are.
	- Have purpose in your life
	- Avoid Rearview mirror syndrome, where you look
	at your past and believe that the future will not be any different.
	- Avoid mediocrity circle of influence, 
	you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with. If 
	you hang out with mediocre people you will be mediocre.
	- Lack of urgency is bad.
2. Productivity is about managing energy, not time
	- To get stuff done, manage your energy.
	- The most productive people usually take more breaks.
	- Use the pomodoro technique, work for 25min, then take 5min break,
	or work for 50min followed by 10min break.
3. It is not about your goals, but your system.
	- The system is about the process that finally leads to achieving your goals.
	- If you have a good system, success is inevitable.
	- Instead of focusing on your goals, examine the processes you plan to follow
	and the actions you will take. Design a path to success.
	
	Action to take
	- Forget about goals, focus on the system instead.
 
	Action steps
	1. Design a system that will get you to where you want to be.
		- Goals are good to set direction. The system is what will get you there.
	2. Make the system motivate you and give you happiness.
		- The feeling you get when you achieve a goal is only momentary. However, if 
		you focus on the system instead, you will enjoy the entire process.

	Explanation
	- The system is about the process that finally leads to the achievement of the goal. If 
	the system is good, success is inevitable. The difference between successful and not successful people
	are not the type of goals they set. They both set the same goals. Yet, some of them become successful and 
	other don't. 
	The difference is the system. Can you be successful without setting goals but with a good system? Yes, you can.

	- Real freedom comes from taking 100% responsibility for your life.
	- You are the only person who can change your life for the better.

	actively work towards solutions.

5. Inner peace is attainable.
	- Don't forget to prioritize your mental health.
	- Work on way to avoid being stressed.
6. Top CEOs read 60 books per year
	- Statistic show that most CEOs and other successful individuals read 4-5 books a month,
	that adds up roughly to 60books a year!
	- There is certainly immense value in the knowledge you can gain from books.
	- Reading is a critical part of self-development.

	Action steps:
	1. Do a self-assessment of your desires and your performance
		- What areas are you lacking in?
		- What do you need to improve on?
		- Make a list of all these things.
	2. Go through your list and pick one improvement you will make.
		- You can continue working through you list once you achieve this goal.
	3. Write down the skills you need to achieve this goal.
		- e.g. If your goal is to become more social, you may think about improving 
		your communication skills.
	4. Search for a relevant book.
		- set aside at least 30min a day to read the book,
		- have a summary and set aside at least 10min a day to read it
		(You can use a reminder app to read the summary, etc.)
	5. Commit to practicing one action from this book.
		- Take action now
